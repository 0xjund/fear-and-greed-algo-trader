# Fear and greed index Algorithmic Trader  

Based on the last project I did on the Cyfrin Python course that made an algorithmic rebalancer, I decided to add the fear and greed index api to balance traders. 

1. The script will allow you to set what level of fear and greed you want to buy and sell. 
2. The script will run every four hours to check the index  
3. The script will use wBTC and USDC for the trades and can be used on any EVM network. 
4. Trades will be executed via Uniswap v3
5. All trades will be logged
